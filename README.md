# hello-world
Thanks for reading my hello.

Here are 4 things you might want to know about me:

1. I'm a happily married father of a toddler. We live in Benicia, CA. 
2. I was last engaged in high tech programming and project management in the early 2000s. 
3. I'm a very good baker. I make sourdough bread for my family from sprouted organic whole wheat. For a while I pursued this professionally. 
4. I'm immensely proud of the fact that I self-installed a grid-tied battery backed-up rooftop solar system on my house. 

Obviously, I'm not your average engineer. Very few currently hot technologies show up on my resume. Yet there's a passion, a fascination with making things work well, that you'll find with the best engineers and managers. Those qualities, I hope, show up wherever my attention is pointed. 

Now, for the first time in two decades, I'm returning to high tech. Why would you consider hiring someone whose skills are so paleolithically out of date? Consider:
* I learn FAST. I taught myself to do major electrical work in 3 months. 
* I don't just make things work, I make them work in a way that other people understand. 
* I deeply understand the value of rapid iteration.
* I'm a low-drama person. 

What I'm looking for:
* A company that makes a difference in the world. That could be in renewable energy, communication, security, or entertainment. Or it could be in some other area.
* A team whose sum is greater than the individual parts.
* Fun.
